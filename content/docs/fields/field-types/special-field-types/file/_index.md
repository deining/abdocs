By default, a file field added to a table will let users upload files. 

When a file field is added to a view, a link to download the file is included.

Files previews can be displayed in an [image/document library]({{<relref "/docs/tiles">}}) tile.

## Version history
When a new file is uploaded (or generated), any previous file is kept as a previous version, displayed with a timestamp, for download by users.

## Generating PDF documents
If a template is uploaded using the [file field options](https://todo.com), the file upload button in the user interface will be replaced by a generate button.

See [document templates](https://todo.com) for more information.
