## Accuracy
Whether to record a date as just a year, year and month, year month and day, or with a time: hours, hh:mm, hh:mm:ss.

## Use current time for new records
If ticked, set the value of this field to the current time when a record is created

## Date format
The format to display in views. Note this doesn't affect data entry screens, which use the browser's standard date picker, which may customise to the user's region.

## Min. years age / Max. years age
These two options specify the valid range of allowable dates for the field. By default values up to 10 years in the future or 100 years in the past are allowed.

> Other types of date check can be added using the [Advanced field checks]({{<relref "#">}}) options for a table
