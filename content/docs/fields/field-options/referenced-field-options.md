## Tabular display
Rather than displaying rows from the referenced view as panels

show a table

which is a more compact form allowing a greater volume of data to be shown in a smaller area.

## Use as a filter for relations
See [Common build patters - custom filtering when using a relation]({{<relref "/docs/advanced-usage/build-patterns#custom-filtering-when-choosing-a-relation">}})

## Prominent
Make the background of the referenced panel bright red - useful for showing warnings on screen.
