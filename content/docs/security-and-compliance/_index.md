agileBase often works best when end users become part of the development process, so they're able to give feedback as your software builds up, also gaining confidence in the end result. So it's quite likely that you'll be adding user accounts relatively early in the process.

It's a good idea to adopt security best practices from the start rather than trying to retro-fit. This guide will take you through the mechanics of creating {{<relref "security-features/users">}} but also explain the steps you can take to ensure data is suitably protected.
