## Logging

If you are using the more advanced features of agilebase workflows then knowing where to look for logging information will become important. At the bottom fo the _workflow_ page of the _manage_ tab of a view is Logging information.

It will list the success and failures of past runs as well as the next time the workflow is scheduled to be run.
