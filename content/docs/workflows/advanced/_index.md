## Logging

If you are using the more advanced features of agilebase workflows then knowing where to look for logging information will become important. At the bottom fo the _workflow - edit records_ panel when editing a view, recent logs are shown.

They will contain success and failures of past runs as well as the next time the workflow is scheduled to be run.
