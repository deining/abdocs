When a comment is added to a record in Agilebase, a copy can be sent to your Slack or Teams workspace, to a specific channel appropriate to the tile. Instructions are in progress, in the meantime please [contact us](https://agilechilli.com/contact-us/) for help setting this up.

Integration with other similar services is also possible should a customer wish - please get in touch if so.
