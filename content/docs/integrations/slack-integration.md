description: Allows comments posted in agileBase to be shared as Slack notifications
---
When a comment is added to a record in agileBase, a copy can be sent to your Slack workspace, to a specific channel appropriate to the tile. Instructions are in progress, in the meantime please [contact us](mailto:support@agilechilli.com) for help setting this up.

Integration with Microsoft Teams or other similar services is also possible should a customer wish - please get in touch if so.
