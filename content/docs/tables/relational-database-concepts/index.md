Before diving into the details of building applications, starting with tables, let's take a step back and learn some background information about databases, including what a table is. If you're familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip this section.

When building back office software with agileBase, a large amount of what we'll be doing is building database structures, to store user-entered data. agileBase takes care of creating the user interface to allow users to use these structures automatically, e.g. to search for data, add and edit it.

You will find many articles explaining relational databases if you look for them on the internet. Most will introduce SQL, the language used to work with databases. It's not necessary to learn that as agileBase generates it automatically behind the scenes, but the higher level concepts are useful to grasp.

If you like learning from videos, this is a good one:
