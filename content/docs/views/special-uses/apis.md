description: Using a view to create an API
---
Any view can be used to generate an API - a unique URL which third party services can call in order to extract data, or which can be used to push data to those services and applications.

The view created in this case is used to define the set of records to send and the fields to include.

For more information, see the [APIs](https://todo.com) topic, which contains full details of how to set up and use APIs.

> This topic also includes information about APIs which receive data from third party systems, as opposed to sending to them, for which a view isn't necessary.
