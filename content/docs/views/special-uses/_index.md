The primary purpose of a view is to show data to users. To let them see, search and report on it, or find individual records to edit.

However, some fundamental aspects of a view make it a very useful feature that can power many core capabilities of agileBase, such as [chasers]({{<relref "/docs/workflows/send-chaser">}}), [workflows]({{<relref "/docs/workflows">}}) and [APIs]({{<relref "/docs/integrations">}}), as well as being useful to administrators in many more minor ways.

A view being a filtered list of records, it can be used to specify those records to act on, i.e. those representing emails to send, workflow actions or data to send to a third party system with an API.

A view is commonly created for the task you wish to accomplish, placing it in a System tile to hide it from users. Then it can be turned to the required purpose in any of the following ways.
