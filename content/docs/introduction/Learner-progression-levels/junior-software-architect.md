### Introduction
A junior software architect can use practically all of the application building functionality of Agilebase. For example
* Create [workflows]({{<relref "/docs/workflows">}}) (including chasers, document generation)
* Set up [APIs]({{<relref "/docs/integrations">}})
* Add complex [joins]({{<relref "/docs/views/joins">}}) to views
* Create, edit and delete [roles]({{<relref "/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles">}})
* Assign [privileges]({{<relref "/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges">}}) to roles or users up to the 'edit' level
* Remove fields, views etc. created by anyone
* Edit the advanced properties of fields and views, including field visibility rules (confidentiality rules) for example

Their only limitations are to do with managing the organisation as a whole, including other users.
