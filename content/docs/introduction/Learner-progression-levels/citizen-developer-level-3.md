### Introduction
A Software Architect (see below) can, at their discretion, assign a citizen developer 3 'develop' privileges on a table (or tables).

That allows them to
* add [fields]({{<relref "/docs/fields">}}) to those table, excluding referenced fields
* remove fields that they themselves have added (not others)
* edit the basic properties of any field in those tables, e.g. the list of options in a dropdown box

Additionally, actions not related to having develop privileges on a particular table are
* edit the basic properties of any regular view. However, workflow, API and some other types of system view will be read-only
