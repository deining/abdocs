**Learning Aim:** To learn how to use the built-in facilities with-in agileBase, demonstrating how a developer can control how the user interacts with the system!


**Prerequisites:** To be an experienced user and to have some experience of personalising the system.


### Introduction

When building tools and functions for your users you will want to control how they interact with the data they are updating or creating. This is true whether building using agileBase or indeed any other tool. 

Agilebase has a multitude of options, features and settings that can be used to tailor the user experience, whilst also providing you levels of control needed to capture valid data.
There are three main areas to the agileBase system that a user interacts with.
They start with **Tiles**. These act as a gateway to the collection of **Lists** they contain. Whilst each **List** provides information about a collection of **Records** with the user interface providing the mechanism for your user to click through to a *Full* **Record**.

We will go through each layer in turn describing the options you as a developer have in controlling them.
