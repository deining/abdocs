## Adding a Chart 
Navigate to the view containing the data for your chart
As a Citizen Developer level 1 you are able to add charts to your own views. 
You don’t need to be in developer mode, simply click the graph icon top right.

### Setting up the chart
Press ‘add chart or map’ and work your way through the steps.
Add data for the x-axis
For this example we can show the distribution in age of the Organisation records.
We can therefore choose Incorporation Date for the X axis, specifically ‘by Year’.
For the Y-axis we want to know how many, which is a ‘Count’ of each Organisation record.
We can skip advanced settings and choose an appropriate Chart type. In this example ‘Packed Columns”
Finally we can change the name of the chart, and press save. 
Hopefully a picture says a thousand words as we look at the graph!
