There's lots to get your teeth into with agileBase, but this guide will give you a quick start.

We won't cover everything, only about 1%, but following this guide will give you a basis on which to build further.

And the work won't be wasted - we'll build a simple database of companies or organisations, which almost every agileBase system needs.

Rather than hand-holding you through the setup, we will outline the process and reference the relevant documentation pages. That way, you'll start to learn how to use the documentation too.

In other words, this quick start is a recommended order in which to look at the reference documentation in order to build a simple application.
