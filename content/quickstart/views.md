The last step is to add some views so users can add and edit data in our tables.

From each of the three tables, [create a view]({{<relref "/docs/views/creating-a-view">}}) and place it in the CRM tile.

We don't need to do anything complex with the view or even edit any options. The simple act of creating it will allow users to see and edit all of the data.

That's it. Enter the user interface (as opposed to the admin interface) and you'll be able to add organisation, site and contact details to your heart's content. Of course, to do anything really interesting with this data you will likely want to create extra tables to suit your own needs - maybe to add sales opportunities or invoices for example.

We'll leave that as an exercise for the reader, but please do get in touch for help and advice on your journey.
