[Back-office software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-office_software) solutions evolved with the emergence of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) as a way of distinguishing them from front-office software, (which typically refers to software used for processes related to things like marketing, sales, interaction tracking, project management and other customer-facing activities).

Whilst agileBase is widely used as front-office platform our unique strength is in our ability to support not only this front end but also the back-office.

Because of the power and flexibility of agileBase there are a really wide range of business processes that can be successfully managed with the platform across all sectors, manufacturing and service related items.

For example:
* Supplier Approval
* New Product Development (NPD)
* Project Management
* Customer Support
* Continuous Improvement Management
* HR
* Staff Training
* Project Portfolio Management
* Order Processing
* Billing
* Interaction Tracking
* etc.

SaaS platforms give organisations a way to simplify and streamline back-office management functions, particularly for companies with multiple locations.
