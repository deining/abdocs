agileBase has been created with some important aims in mind

* to create software that people find enjoyable to use, which manifests in many ways, most obviously the attractive and colourful user interface, but also because it can match user's requirements exactly
* to support the full ambitions of business owners. It's simple to get started but the platform has a very high *technical ceiling* - there's not much you can't accomplish
* to make the most out of an organisation workforce's perhaps un-tapped skills and experience, allowing people to take full ownership of their own areas of their business
